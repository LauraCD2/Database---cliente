# Database---cliente
This is my first repo, now I'm working on src-model-ClienteModel using Data you can find on scr-utils as: aplicacion, biblioteca, cliente, consultas, contenido, distribuidora, juego, modificaciones.

Let me know what do you think about it, I'm learning java.

In *Reto 4 - MISIÓN TIC 2022* you could find the "database" sample.

In *Reto 5 - MISIÓN TIC 2022* you could find the objectives and what is gonna be evaluated in this repo project.
